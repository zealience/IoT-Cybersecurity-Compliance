## Description <a name='desc'></a>
Did you download our Technical Documentation template available in 📂EN18031-Templates? If you're unsure how to identify the applicable requirements for your device and document them, you can find supplementary resources here. Specifically, we provide workflows for the hEN 18031 requirements.

## Available workflows <a name='avail'></a>
### Technical Documentation Workflow for EN18031-1
- ACM AUM
- SSM
- SCM, SUM, GEC... (coming soon🚀)

### Technical Documentation Workflow for EN18031-2
- (coming soon🚀)

## Objectives <a name='obj'></a>
These workflows enable you to:
1. Identify the 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀 to be protected according to the standards
2. Identify the applicable requirements concerning the 𝗺𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗺𝘀 needed to protect these assets
3. Document in a structured way the necessary information to demonstrate compliance with the standards

At each step, the workflows indicates what information needs to be captured in your Technical Documentation. In case you have not started your Technical Documentation, you can use our template available in this repo.

## Key take-aways <a name='key'></a>
1. It all starts with the assets: You need to identify and classify your assets in order to apply the right requirements. Regarding how to identify assets, please read our articles on the [Zealience Resource Hubs](https://zealience.com/resource-hub/articles).
2. You cannot scope upfront: As depicted in the workflows, the identification of applicable requirements calls for multiple iterations over assets and mechanisms.
3. Everything needs to be documented: Even when a requirement is not applicable, you still need to document and justify why it is not so.

## How to use the workflows <a name='use'></a>
1. Download our Technical Documentation Template
2. Identify your security and network assets 
   - You can list them in the template worksheets "Overview-SecAssets" and "Overview-NetAssets". For each, indicate its type (column B), whether it is sensitive or confidential (column C) and provide a description (column D).
3. Go through the workflows from top to bottom, while iterating as many times as needed to cover all your assets/mechanisms.
   - Whenever you reach numbers (in black circles), you need to refer to the designated box on the right side and document accordingly.
   
## Note <a name='note'></a>
In line with the standard, the workflow assumes that the assets are already identified. If you need help with their identification, you can read our guidance on the [Zealience Resource Hubs](https://zealience.com/resource-hub/articles).

If you are looking for software to automate these workflows, have a look at our [Zealience website](https://zealience.com).
